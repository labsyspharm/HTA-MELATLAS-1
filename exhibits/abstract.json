One of the clusters, T5b, was spatially restricted to the invasive tumor boundary (arrow) and had tumor cells expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II; inset top). Although MHC-II is primarily expressed on antigen presenting immune cells, exposure to interferon-gamma (IFNy) can lead to up-regulation of MHC-II in tumor cells as well. We observed an up-regulation of interferon-gamma in the invasive tumor boundary (IB) via microregional transcriptomics, suggesting signals from the tumor microenvironment can drive tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, neighborhood analysis revealed there was a significant co-occurrence between PDL1+ macrophages and cells in cluster T5b (inset bottom).\n![](../images/abstract_waypoint4_IFNg_signaling.png)", "Arrows": [{"Text": "", "HideArrow": false, "Point": [1.0851265781001898, 0.46361415569972725], "Angle": 60}, {"Text": "", "HideArrow": false, "Point": [1.0967929794830094, 0.4894075085751976], "Angle": 60}, {"Text": "", "HideArrow": false, "Point": [1.1258105014679134, 0.47735929769257657], "Angle": 60}], "Overlays": [], "Group": "IFNg signaling", "Masks": [], "ActiveMasks": [], "Zoom": 9.478071799463793, "Pan": [1.0921476305687594, 0.47581084805449325]}, {"Name": "PDL1+ dendritic cells ", "Description": "The spatial cell-to-cell proximity analysis revealed significant co-localization of CD11C+ PDL1+ dendritic cells (orange) and terminally exhausted TIM3+ T cells (cyan), suggesting PDL1-PD1 ligand-receptor interactions between these cell types and that PDL1+ myeloid cells are one of the drivers of immune suppression within the invasive tumor front.
